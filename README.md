A donut chart shows the distribution of sales based on fat content:
   - Low Fat products account for $574K (57.4%) of total sales
   - Regular fat products make up $426K (42.6%) of sales

This indicates a slight consumer preference for low-fat options, which could inform inventory and marketing decisions.

This suggests that customers are more satisfied with low-fat options, which aligns with the higher sales for these products.

These allow users to drill down into specific segments of the data for more detailed analysis.

   - The "Welcome to Grocery SALES ANALYSIS DASHBOARD" header clearly identifies the purpose of the dashboard

Key Insights and Recommendations:

1. Product Focus: Given the high sales and ratings of Fruits and Vegetables, the business should ensure consistent quality and availability of these items. There's also an opportunity to boost sales in lower-performing categories like Starchy Foods and Hard Drinks.

2. Health Trends: The preference for low-fat products in both sales and ratings suggests a health-conscious customer base. The business could capitalize on this by expanding its range of healthy options and marketing them prominently.

3. Customer Satisfaction: The high average rating (3.9/5) indicates good overall customer satisfaction. However, there's room for improvement, especially in regular fat products.

4. Sales Strategy: With an average sale of $141, there might be opportunities to increase basket size through cross-selling or promotions.

5. Data-Driven Decisions: The various filters allow for granular analysis by location type, outlet size, and item type. This can inform inventory management and store-specific strategies.

6. Product Mix Optimization: The detailed breakdown of sales by item type allows for fine-tuning of the product mix to maximize profitability and meet customer demands.

This Power BI dashboard provides a powerful tool for the grocery app to understand its sales performance, customer preferences, and areas for potential growth. By leveraging these insights, the business can make data-driven decisions to improve product offerings, marketing strategies, and overall customer satisfaction.
